Hello,

I'm Abhiroop, a graduate student currently studying Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington. My professional journey has led me to AiKYNETIX, where I serve as a Machine Learning Engineer, focusing on converting PyTorch-based pose estimation models into CoreML formats. I also contribute as a Research Assistant at the IU Computer Vision Lab, delving into solutions for multi-view stereo challenges.

Prior to my graduate studies, I gained experience as a Computer Vision Engineer at Segmind, where I played a role in developing VoltaML, a library aimed at enhancing the speed of ML model inference. I began my journey in the AI field as a Machine Learning Engineer at Onward Assist, working on AI algorithms to improve medical diagnostics, including cancer detection.

I'm committed to leveraging my academic background and practical experiences to excel in a Machine Learning Engineer role, contributing meaningfully to the field while continuing to learn and grow.

Thanks for visiting!

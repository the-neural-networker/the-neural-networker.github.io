## Experience 

**Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS)** <br>
_Oct 2022 – Present_ <br>
Research Assistant - Machine Learning Bloomington, Indiana, USA <br>
- Collaborating with the Nolan Lab at Stanford and the Van Valen Lab at CalTech in performing single-cell segmentation and cell neighborhood
analysis on CODEX multiplexed imaging data from 7 organs and integrating the pipeline into HuBMAP’s Human Reference Atlas.

**Segmind** <br>
_Apr 2022 – Jul 2022_ <br>
Computer Vision (CV) Consultant Hyderabad, Telangana, India <br>
- **VoltaML**
  - Developed a lightweight library to accelerate AI, ML, and DL models by optimizing, compiling, and deploying to target CPU and GPU devices.
  - Accelerated model inference by up to 10x compared to native PyTorch by leveraging ONNX, TorchScript, TensorRT, and Apache TVM
  - Incorporated pipelines for accelerating image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and natural language processing models.
- **Object Detection in Aerial Drone Videos**
  - Developed an object detection tool to detect minuscule objects (<5x5 pixels) in aerial drone videos.
  - Achieved an mAP of 0.72 and reduced manual annotation effort by 50%.
  
**Onward Assist** <br>
_Jan 2020 – May 2022_ <br>
Machine Learning Engineer Hyderabad, Telangana, India
- **MoNuSAC: Multi-Organ Nuclei Segmentation and Nuclei Classification**
  - Pioneered U-HoVerNet, a network to segment cells in regions of interest (ROI) in whole slide images, scoring a Panoptic Quality (PQ) of 0.39.
  - Secured 6th place in the post-challenge leaderboard of the MoNuSAC 2020 competition.
  - Co-authored the MoNuSAC2020: A Multi-organ Nuclei Segmentation and Classification Challenge paper, published in IEEE TMI.
- **Lung Nodule Detection in Chest Radiographs**
  - Implemented FasterRCNN, and RetinaNet models to classify and detect cancerous lung nodules in chest X-Rays.
  - Attained an AUROC of 0.83 for nodule classification and mean IoU of 0.76 for nodule detection after fine-tuning and hyperparameter search.
  
- **Real-time Medical Image Stitching**
  - Implemented an end-to-end medical image stitcher using OpenCV that stitches frames captured from a camera-mounted microscope.
  - Facilitated real-time stitching of frames with exceptional quality, by propelling stitching speed to more than 10 frames per second.
  - Created a desktop application for the tool using PyQt5 and integrated the app into TelePathDx, a digital pathology platform by Onward.

## Projects

**Equitable Data Valuation for Image Segmentation** <br>
_Feb 2021 - Dec 2021_
  - Applied KNN-Shapley, a metric used to determine the quality of data based on the training algorithm used, to image segmentation algorithms.
  - Detected 80% of poor-quality data by inspecting the lowest 20% of KNN-Shapley valued training data points, validating the research approach.
  
**Paper Reproduction** <br>
_Apr 2022_
- Reproduced 2 papers viz., “Image Style Transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks” and “Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep
Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks”.
